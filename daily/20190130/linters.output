Enabled by your configuration linters:
unused: Checks Go code for unused constants, variables, functions and types [fast: false]
govet (vet, vetshadow): Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string [fast: true]
errcheck: Errcheck is a program for checking for unchecked errors in go programs. These unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases [fast: true]
structcheck: Finds an unused struct fields [fast: true]
varcheck: Finds unused global variables and constants [fast: true]
ineffassign: Detects when assignments to existing variables are not used [fast: true]
deadcode: Finds unused code [fast: true]
typecheck: Like the front-end of a Go compiler, parses and type-checks Go code [fast: true]
staticcheck: Staticcheck is a go vet on steroids, applying a ton of static analysis checks [fast: false]
gosimple: Linter for Go source code that specializes in simplifying a code [fast: false]

Disabled by your configuration linters:
golint: Golint differs from gofmt. Gofmt reformats Go source code, whereas golint prints out style mistakes [fast: true]
stylecheck: Stylecheck is a replacement for golint [fast: false]
gosec (gas): Inspects source code for security problems [fast: true]
interfacer: Linter that suggests narrower interface types [fast: false]
unconvert: Remove unnecessary type conversions [fast: true]
dupl: Tool for code clone detection [fast: true]
goconst: Finds repeated strings that could be replaced by a constant [fast: true]
gocyclo: Computes and checks the cyclomatic complexity of functions [fast: true]
gofmt: Gofmt checks whether code was gofmt-ed. By default this tool runs with -s option to check for code simplification [fast: true]
goimports: Goimports does everything that gofmt does. Additionally it checks unused imports [fast: true]
maligned: Tool to detect Go structs that would take less memory if their fields were sorted [fast: true]
depguard: Go linter that checks if package imports are in a list of acceptable packages [fast: true]
misspell: Finds commonly misspelled English words in comments [fast: true]
lll: Reports long lines [fast: true]
unparam: Reports unused function parameters [fast: false]
nakedret: Finds naked returns in functions greater than a specified function length [fast: true]
prealloc: Finds slice declarations that could potentially be preallocated [fast: true]
scopelint: Scopelint checks for unpinned variables in go programs [fast: true]
gocritic: The most opinionated Go source code linter [fast: true]
gochecknoinits: Checks that no init functions are present in Go code [fast: true]
gochecknoglobals: Checks that no globals are present in Go code [fast: true]
