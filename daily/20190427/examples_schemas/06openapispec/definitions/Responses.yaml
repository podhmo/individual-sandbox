    description: A container for the expected responses of an operation. The container
      maps a HTTP response code to the expected response.  It is not expected for
      the documentation to necessarily cover all possible HTTP response codes, since
      they may not be known in advance. However, it is expected for the documentation
      to cover a successful operation response and any known errors.  The `default`
      MAY be used as a default response object for all HTTP codes  that are not covered
      individually by the specification.  The `Responses Object` MUST contain at least
      one response code, and it  SHOULD be the response for a successful operation
      call.
