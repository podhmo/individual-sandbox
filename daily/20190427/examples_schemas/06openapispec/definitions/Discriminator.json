      "description": "When request bodies or response payloads may be one of a number of different schemas, a `discriminator` object can be used to aid in serialization, deserialization, and validation.  The discriminator is a specific object in a schema which is used to inform the consumer of the specification of an alternative schema based on the value associated with it.  Note, when using the discriminator, _inline_ schemas will not be considered when using the discriminator."
