    description: A simple object to allow referencing other components in the specification,
      internally and externally.  The Reference Object is defined by JSON Reference
      and follows the same structure, behavior and rules.   For this specification,
      reference resolution is done as defined by the JSON Reference specification
      and not by the JSON Schema specification.
