    description: 'The Header Object follows the structure of the Parameter Object,
      with the following changes:  1. `name` MUST NOT be specified, it is given in
      the Headers Object. 1. `in` MUST NOT be specified, it is implicitly in `header`.
      1. All traits that are affected by the location MUST be applicable to a location
      of `header` (for example, `style`).'
